# Frequently Asked Questions

## How old do I need to be to join?
We are an organization designed for teenagers (ages 13-19).

## How do I help grow Generation Bitcoin even if I'm not a teenager?
You can add helpful resources to our [Resources](../resources.html) page by making a pull request on GitHub or DM'ing us on Twitter. You can also DM us if you would be interested in being a guest speaker!

## What should I do if I don't know anything about Bitcoin but am eager to start learning?
It's totally okay to join GenB if you're not familiar with Bitcoin. Everyone starts somewhere! We'd recommend that you check out some of the beginner resources listed on the [Resources](../resources.html) page as these have helped out our members initially learn about Bitcoin as well.

## What if I'm interested in cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin?
Generation Bitcoin is, as the name implies, a Bitcoin-only group focused on helping teens get into this space. Though, even if you're interetsed in alternative assets, you're welcome to join us to learn about Bitcoin. No shilling.
