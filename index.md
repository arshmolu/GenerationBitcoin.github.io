## Who We Are

Generation Bitcoin is a community of teens focused on learning about Bitcoin together. The group started at the beginning of 2022, and the number of members has steadily increased since then. 

Autumn and Ishaana met at the NYC bitdevs meetups in September, and being the only teens there, they began to learn about Bitcoin together. They sent resources back and forth, and as time went on a third member was added and the method of learning was shifted to online weekly calls. As this little group started, the members realized that there werenâ€™t any communities for teens like this out there. They knew that educating teens about bitcoin is vital as they will be the next generation taking this work forward. They wanted to create a community to help young people learn about bitcoin, hence the start of Generation Bitcoin. 

## How the Meetings Work

The meetings will revolve around reading the decided-on resources during the week, and coming to the meetings prepared with questions/thoughts about the reading. Since there is a diverse interest in the group (bitcoin development, design, economics,  politics, etc), we will break into different groups focused on what you are interested in. There will be a few selections of books on different topics and each member can choose which book club they want to join. 

In addition to the reading, there will be designated time for peers to present on a specific topic like privacy, mining, transactions, etc. These presentations can be led by anyone who wants to present on the topic of their choice. 

Later down the line, we will have guest speakers come and talk about a topic of interest. These will be held primarily online, however, if there are enough people in one area then we will have those meetings in person and have hands-on workshops as well. 

Lastly, Gen B wants to help teens learn, as well as create an environment where they can build in the space as well. Since teens in the group have certain skills within the space already; like programming, designing, etc, members can come up with project ideas and build a team to create the project. For example, there are three group members right now working on creating a testnet wallet. We have a backend person writing the code for the wallet in python. We have a UX designer creating an interactive prototype on Figma, and we have a front-end developer implementing the prototype design. 

## How to Start Learning:
Although this group is only for teens, we do want to help and support as many people as we can to join the space. If you are looking for resources to look into for different aspects of bitcoin, you can check out our [resources page](../resources).
