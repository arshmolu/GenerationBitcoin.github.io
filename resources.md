# Resources

This is a resource list for people who are just starting out in bitcoin, compiled together by our members, who can personally vouch for them. 

This list is still a work in progress, however, so if you have any recommendations yourself, feel free to leave a [pull request](https://github.com/GenerationBitcoin/GenerationBitcoin.github.io/pulls). 
## Key

Boldface resources are for beginners. 

Italicized resources are more advanced.

If a resource is not styled, it is medium-level.
